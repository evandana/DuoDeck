Fitness Deck of Cards Workout: With a Partner!

DeckWorkout will provide a convenient way to perform a “deck of cards”
workout. In a deck of cards workout, suits are assigned exercises and
the athlete completes the number of repetitions associated with the
value of the card flipped. For example, if Spades represent sit-ups and
an Ace of Spades is flipped, the athlete would do 14 sit-ups. This app
will allow some customization of the exercises associated with suits and
the size of the deck. Users will be encouraged to continue to use the
app by seeing their progress tracked.
