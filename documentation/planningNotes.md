Deck Battle

?? QUESTIONS

Allow music to play in the background?

Abstract

Connect with another player and compete at finishing a "deck of cards"
workout. Customization possible. Incentives. Scheduled workouts.

Goal

Use principles of user engagement to increase user's fitness.

\* Accountability: Make a schedule and then keep to it.

        - Does schedule mean arranging some set of cards based on the
workout needs?

        - May be some set of predefined schedules that comes with the
app?

\* Competition: Play against someone else

- Does this include some kind of app-to-app communication using the same
wifi connection or something else? or maybe something simple?

\* Goal tracking: Best stats (personal and vs group)

\* Social: Talk about it (share on FB)

\* Pride: Earn badges

\* Unlock: Unlock features

BONUS

\* FaceTime with someone while doing it

\* Race to tap "next" while watching them

\* Could it reliably count for you?

\* Show "how to" for exercises
